# Multivariate-Polynomial

This app can store polynomials up to 4 variables in each multivariate (x,y,z,k) into a linked list and perform add and multiply functions on them. The format of each multivariate should be like this in order to recognize it: (There is no need to use all 4 variables)

```
(((((A)x^a)y^b)z^c)k^d)
```

Two examples of a valid input:

```
((7)x^2)z^2+((2)y^1)z^1+((6)x^3)z^0

((4)y^1)z^3+((9)x^2)z^2+((3)y^1)z^1
```
